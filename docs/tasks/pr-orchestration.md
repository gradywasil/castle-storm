# PR Orchestration: Castle Storm Visual & Playable Redesign

## Overview
Redesign Castle Storm from the minimalist ink-on-paper tarot card table into an accessible, visually rich, and intuitive medieval strategy/idle experience. Sliced into phased incremental PRs:
1. Core playable loop stabilization and structured presenter contracts.
2. Dedicated modular view components (Top HUD, Village & Production, Roster & Armory, Castle Siege).
3. Primary viewport integration and boot shell swap.
4. Visual polish, asset dressing, and acceptance test sweep.
